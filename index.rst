JDA strives to provide a clean and full wrapping of the Discord REST api and its Websocket-Events for Java.

Besides receiving audio, this library is full featured, allowing every operation that the Discord API provides.

If you need help, or just want to talk with the JDA or other Discord Devs, you can join the `Unofficial Discord API <https://discord.gg/0SBTUU1w>`_ or the `Official JDA <https://discord.gg/0hMr4ce0tIk3pSjp>`_ Server.
